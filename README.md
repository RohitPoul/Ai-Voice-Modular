# Ai-Voice-Modular
AI Voice Modular is a Python-based tool that lets you create AI-generated songs with ease. By providing input audio files and leveraging RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion), this project enables the transformation of vocals into high-quality, AI-modulated outputs. Ideal for musicians, sound designers, and AI enthusiasts, AI Voice Modular combines simplicity with advanced voice synthesis to help you explore and create unique audio experiences.

## Features:

- AI Song Generation: Input audio files and transform them into new, AI-generated voices.
- Voice Modulation with RVC: Uses retrieval-based voice conversion for improved vocal quality and realistic outputs.
- Customizable and Extendable: Easily tweak and expand the system to experiment with different vocal styles and effects.

1) Download all the dependecies with following code:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
I recommend you to create environment to run this model.
(you may face problems in fairseq so be careful)
2) Download the models by running download_models.py

3) To download the torchvision cuda to run on local machine.
refer this link - https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

4) I have take inspiration for alot of sources to create this project and special thankx to my friend Siddhart Mane for helping me with this idea and exicution.

5) For downloading rvc models - https://rvc-models.com/
